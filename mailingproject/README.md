The application aims at adding subscriber email and sending out mails.

To install, you'll want a virtual environment with the following:

1. pip install django sendgrid 
2.Create an account twilio sendigrid (https://www.twilio.com/sendgrid/email-api) and create api key for using the settings.py page
3.Replace your SENDGRID_API_KEY
3.Replace your email Id in settings.py where it asks for USER NAME
4.login with super user in admin panel where u can add subscriber and send mails to all the recipients.

There are few errors in the code which will be fixed in coming days.
